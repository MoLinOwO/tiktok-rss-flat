      <title>Running 100 miles solo and unsupported means carrying a lot of gear. You never know what you'll need, so it's best to pack a bit on the heavy side. In the end, I used almost everything except my med kit. It's better to be over-prepared than under-prepared</title>

      <title>I arrived at Leadville (10,200' above sea level) and immediately needed a nap. Long day of travel kicked my butt. The whole time, I was dreaming I was suffocating. I woke up out of breath with a headache. @cwarreninspire convinced me to do a little shake </title>
